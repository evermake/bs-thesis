This work demonstrates that modern functional programming and code generation tools can be combined to build an extensible, scope-safe Hindley-Milner type-checker. Using BNFC, Free Foil, and Haskell, we developed a prototype with level-based generalization as a proof of concept.

Our main contributions are the following. First, we presented an algorithm for Hindley-Milner type inference with level-based generalization that separates constraint generation from solving â€” algorithm $\mathcal{L}$. Second, we implemented the algorithm in Haskell using generic, scope-safe abstract syntax generated through Free~Foil. Third, we developed a test-suite and validated our implementation against it, which, to some extent, empirically verifies the correctness of the algorithm. Finally, we have proposed practical next steps for evolving the prototype into a reusable type inference library.

The contributions of this work have also been presented as part of a talk at WITS'25\footnote{\textit{Towards Generic Type Checking Implementations in Haskell via Second-Order Abstract Syntax}, Workshop on the Implementation of Type Systems, \url{https://popl25.sigplan.org/details/wits-2025-papers/6/Towards-Generic-Type-Checking-Implementations-in-Haskell-via-Second-Order-Abstract-Sy}}.
