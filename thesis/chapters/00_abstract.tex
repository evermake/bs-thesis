we present a proof-of-concept implementation of the Hindley-Milner-style type inference algorithm based on free foil (framework for generating generic and intrinsically scoped abstract syntax) that utilizes the idea of levels introduced by Remy, which is applied in OCaml and Haskell programming languages for more efficient let-generalization. we later discuss how the idea of levels could be generalized.
