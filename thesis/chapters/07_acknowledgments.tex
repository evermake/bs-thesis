\chapter{Acknowledgments}
\label{chap:ack}

I would like to thank my supervisor, Nikolai Kudasov, for his advice, and invaluable support in learning type theory and Haskell, as well as for his thorough approach to work and science in general.

I am also very grateful to my colleagues, Diana Tomilovskaia and Anastasia Smirnova, for their feedback and insights, which we shared during the discussions related to our works.
