\section{Hindley-Milner Type System}

In 1969, Hindley discovered an approach of computing a principal type-scheme for a given object in combinatory logic \cite{Hindley1969_PrincipalTypeScheme}. Later, in 1978, Milner introduced an algorithm for deducing polymorphic type for a given program — algorithm $\mathcal{W}$ \cite{Milner1978_TypePolymorphism}. Both Hindley's and Milner's works are about getting the most general type of a given term only by its usage, which turned out to be an important feature for the programming languages. Their findings are at the core of type systems of modern functional programming languages like ML, OCaml, and Haskell.

Hindley-Milner type system is so popular because of it's flexibility due to polymorphism and robustness due to completeness and soundness, which allowed to write shorter but at the same time fully-typed programs.

\section{Levels}

In 1982 Damas and Milner \cite{DamasMilner1982_TypeSchemes} have shown an implementation of \texttt{let}-generalization — Algorithm~$\mathcal{W}$, which, however, is inefficient as it requires looking through the entire type environment.
A more efficient algorithm has been discovered by R\'emy~\cite{Remy1992_SortedEqTheoryTypes} and shown to be successfully adopted in the OCaml programming language \cite{Kiselyov2022_OCamplTypeChecker}, although it is not widely-known.
