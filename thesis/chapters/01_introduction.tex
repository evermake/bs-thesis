Type system is a crucial part of any formal system, for example a programming language or a proof assistant. In a world of functional programming, discovery of the Hindley-Milner type system played an important role of the field advancement. Ideas discovered by Hindley, Milner, and Damas are at the core of type systems of today's most powerful functional programming languages like ML, OCaml, and Haskell. <добавить про то, что HM популярен из-за того, что он (1) относительно простой, (2) completeness and soundness are proved, (3) поддерживает parametric polymorphsim>

<здесь нужно сказать что при имплементации тайпчекера для HM придётся столкнуться с рядом проблем. нужно объяснить с примерами 2 основные проблемы: (1) как реализовать name management и (2) как реализовать правильную и эффективную generalization>

Definitely, numerous implementations of the Hindley-Milner type system can be found in both academic literature and open-source projects. However, this work aims to popularize two not so popular approaches.

...

First, in our implementation we use

...

Second, we use an old but not widely adopted idea of levels (or ranks) to implement more efficient type generalization than that which is used in algorithm $\mathcal{W}$ and similar ones. 

...

In this work, we present an implementation of a Hindley-Milner-style type inference algorithm with generalization via levels in Haskell, which is based on scope-safe abstract syntax generated with Free Foil framework, for a language similar to lambda calculus.
