Presentation slides with sli.dev



The presentation is supposed to have approximately the following structure:

1. Title (thesis title, your name, your supervisor(s), your track, indicate if it is BS/MS).
2. Context of your work (1â€“2 slides, 2â€“3 minutes)
  - problem statement (1 slide, 1 minute)
    - what are you doing in your thesis? (clearly separate your (planned) contribution from existing work)
    - how will you know that you have succeeded? (evaluation criteria: testing, comparison benchmarks, proof of correctness, etc.)
  - literature review/related work that you have already analysed (2â€“3 slides, 10 minutes)
  - preliminary results (1 slide, 1â€“2 minutes)
  - plan of work for your thesis (1 slide, 1 minute)
  - ideally, a list of references (bibliography)

Slides should ideally be discussed with me prior to presentation.

Slides can be prepared using any software, but please:

1. Do not use dark theme (it does not work well on projectors)!
2. Avoid screenshots, but if you use screenshots, make them in light theme (same reason as above)!
3. Avoid writing too much text on the slides (use presenter's notes for that), the slides should contain key points.
4. Avoid writing too little text on the slides (we still need to have proper amount of information).
5. Cite your sources (where did you get the information/picture/diagram/etc.).
6. Provide links to things you made (GitHub repo, pull requests, other artifacts).
7. Mention people you work with!
8. Don't overthink it, this is not graded, and your next presentation will be better anyway ðŸ™‚

If you are making a slide, but unsure if it is needed, you can always put it at the end (after "Thank you") and use it to answer questions, or clarify things if needed.
